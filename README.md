## üîê Authentication & Security

- **JWT Authentication:** Ensures stateless, secure user sessions.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Only users with admin roles can access sensitive routes and management dashboards.
- **Secure API:** All endpoints are protected via middleware validating authentication and authorization.
- **Password Security:** User passwords are hashed using industry standards before database storage.

## ‚ö° Getting Started: Running Locally

### 1. Clone the Repositories

    git clone <backend-repo-url>
    git clone <frontend-repo-url>

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate into each repository folder and install dependencies:

    cd backend
    npm install

    cd ../frontend
    npm install

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both backend and frontend with the following variables.

#### Backend `.env`

PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT secret key>
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<Your Cloudinary cloud name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<Your Cloudinary API key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<Your Cloudinary API secret>



#### Frontend `.env`

REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

text

*Adjust URLs and keys according to your environment and deployment.*

### 4. Start the Servers

In separate terminal windows or tabs:

- Start Backend:

cd backend
npm run dev



- Start Frontend:

cd frontend
npm start



The frontend will usually run on `http://localhost:3000` and the backend on the port specified in your `.env`.

## üß© Project Structure Overview

### Backend

- `controllers/` ‚Äì Route controllers managing request logic
- `models/` ‚Äì Mongoose schemas and models
- `routes/` ‚Äì API endpoints (users, auth, problems, submissions)
- `middleware/` ‚Äì Authentication and authorization middleware
- `utils/` ‚Äì Helper functions (e.g., Cloudinary uploader)
- `server.js` ‚Äì Application entry point

### Frontend

- `src/components/` ‚Äì Reusable UI components (Editor, Dashboard, Profile)
- `src/pages/` ‚Äì Page-level components (Home, Login, Admin)
- `src/redux/` ‚Äì Redux slices and store setup
- `src/api/` ‚Äì API client configurations using React Query
- `src/styles/` ‚Äì Tailwind CSS configurations and custom styles
- `src/App.js` ‚Äì Root component with routing

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Passwords are never stored in plain text; they use bcrypt hashing.
- JWT tokens are signed with a strong secret and include expiration.
- API endpoints are protected with authentication and role checks.
- File uploads are validated before processing with Cloudinary.
- Rate limiting can be added to prevent brute force attacks (recommended for production).
